# Apex_Head2Head

### I've since stopped working on this after realizing how limited the Apex Legends API is.

Many of the stats that I wanted to pull for each character is dependent on what Badges the player has equipped on their characters in-game.
This means that, unless the player equips the right badges before using this app, those statistics are unavailable to be pulled from.

I'm keeping this repository up in case I need a reminder on how to pull from an api in the future.
